FEATURE: allow people to pick from our pre-selected colors (+1)
FEATURE: remember the last color they picked (+2)
    So the suggestion is: Please consider adding a feature to allow this - a kind of "memory" for selected colors. Simplest would be just remembering one previous color choice, better could be having a stack or list of upto, say, 5 or 10 colors, so the user can go back (and forth) and set any previously selected one as the current "final" color. If they select more than 10 you could "forget" the older ones.
